            <p>Welcome to Duckburg, the crown jewel of the state of Calisota! This bustling metropolis is a must-visit
                destination for any enthusiast or adventure seeker.</p>
            <p>The illustrious history of our beloved Duckburg stretches back to the 16th century when the British
                explorer Sir Francis Drake established Fort Drake Borough on what is now known as Killmotor Hill. This
                strategic location served as a vital outpost for British interests in the region for over two centuries.
            </p>
            <p>In 1818, a pivotal moment in our city's history occurred when the enterprising Cornelius Coot acquired
                the fort from its departing British occupants. Coot, demonstrating the ingenuity that would become a
                hallmark of Duckburg's citizens, renamed the settlement "Fort Duckburg" and transformed it into a
                thriving trading post. Under his stewardship, a small town began to flourish around the fort, attracting
                settlers and laying the foundation for our future metropolis.</p>
            <p>However, it wasn't until the arrival of the legendary Scrooge McDuck in the early 20th century that
                Duckburg truly began its ascent to greatness. McDuck's decision to construct his iconic Mansion on
                Killmotor Hill in 1902 sparked an unprecedented economic boom. As Scrooge's wealth and influence grew,
                so did our fair city, rapidly expanding from a modest town into the bustling urban center we know today.
                By 1930, when Scrooge claimed the title of the world's richest duck, Duckburg had firmly established
                itself as a major metropolitan area and a global financial powerhouse. Today, Duckburg stands as a
                testament to the vision of Cornelius Coot, the business acumen of Scrooge McDuck, and the indomitable
                spirit of its citizens.</p>
