    <h1>Visit Duckburg</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Duckburg, the crown jewel of the fictional state of Calisota! This bustling metropolis is a must-visit
        destination for any enthusiast or adventure seeker.</p>
    <p>Founded in the 16th century as Fort Drake Borough by the British explorer Sir Francis Drake, Duckburg has a rich
        history that spans centuries. The fort was later renamed by Cornelius Coot, whose statue still stands proudly in
        the city today. However, it wasn't until the arrival of the wealthy businessman Scrooge McDuck that Duckburg
        truly flourished into the thriving city we know and love.</p>
    <h2>Attractions</h2>
    <p>The city's most iconic landmark is undoubtedly Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin. This impressive structure serves as
        both a testament to Scrooge's wealth and a magnet for adventurers and would-be thieves alike. While you can't
        swim in the money (that's a privilege reserved for Scrooge himself), the exterior is a sight to behold.</p>
    <p>For thrill-seekers, a visit to Old Demon Tooth mountain is a must. This ominously named peak offers breathtaking
        views of the city and surrounding areas. Nature enthusiasts will also appreciate the city's proximity to diverse
        landscapes, perfect for day trips and outdoor activities.</p>
    <h2>Industry and Innovation</h2>
    <p>Duckburg is at the forefront of technological advancement, boasting a thriving space exploration industry.
        Science and technology buffs will find plenty to marvel at, from cutting-edge laboratories to futuristic
        inventions that seem to pop up on every street corner.</p>
    <h2>Local Heroes</h2>
    <h3>Gizmoduck</h3>
    <p>Keep your eyes peeled for Duckburg's very own superhero, GizmoDuck! This tech-savvy crimefighter can often be
        seen patrolling the city streets on his signature unicycle. While you're unlikely to need rescuing during your
        visit, it's always exciting to catch a glimpse of this local legend in action.</p>
    <h3>Masked Mallard</h3>
    <h3>Darkwing Duck</h3>
    <h2>Getting Around</h2>
    <p>Duckburg is well-connected to neighboring cities, including the notorious St. Canard, home of the caped crusader
        Darkwing Duck. The Audubon Bay Bridge serves as a vital link between these two dynamic urban centers.</p>
    <p>Whether you're interested in history, technology, adventure, or simply soaking in the unique atmosphere of a city
        where anthropomorphic ducks and humans once coexisted (before the mysterious duck revolution), Duckburg offers
        something for everyone. So pack your bags, bring your sense of wonder, and prepare for a vacation that's sure to
        be "like a hurricane" â€“ in the best possible way!</p>
