        <p>Welcome to Duckburg, the crown jewel of the state of Calisota! This bustling metropolis is a must-visit
            destination for any enthusiast or adventure seeker.</p>
        <p>Founded in the 16th century as Fort Drake Borough by the British explorer Sir Francis Drake, Duckburg has a
            rich
            history that spans centuries. The fort was later renamed by Cornelius Coot, whose statue still stands
            proudly in
            the city today. However, it wasn't until the arrival of the wealthy businessman Scrooge McDuck that Duckburg
            truly flourished into the thriving city we know and love.</p>
        <h2>Attractions</h2>
        <p>The city's most iconic landmark is undoubtedly Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin. This impressive structure serves
            as
            both a testament to Scrooge's wealth and a magnet for adventurers and would-be thieves alike. While you
            can't
            swim in the money (that's a privilege reserved for Scrooge himself), the exterior is a sight to behold.</p>
        <p>For thrill-seekers, a visit to Old Demon Tooth mountain is a must. This ominously named peak offers
            breathtaking
            views of the city and surrounding areas. Nature enthusiasts will also appreciate the city's proximity to
            diverse
            landscapes, perfect for day trips and outdoor activities.</p>
        <h2>Industry and Innovation</h2>
        <p>Duckburg is at the forefront of technological advancement, boasting a thriving space exploration industry.
            Science and technology buffs will find plenty to marvel at, from cutting-edge laboratories to futuristic
            inventions that seem to pop up on every street corner.</p>
